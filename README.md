Notebooks for interacting with FFRD data

To acquire data from s3 you will first need to provide two access keys within a secrets.env file, located in the root folder of the project folder. Copy and paste both the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY without quotes or spaces and remove the <> symbols from the template version. After saving edits to the secrets.env file, rebuild the dev container to begin using the notebooks.
